# Employee Attrition Analysis Notebook

This GitHub repository hosts a Jupyter notebook titled `attrition.ipynb`, focusing on analyzing employee attrition. The notebook is structured into distinct parts, each aimed at handling different aspects of the analysis process.

## Overview

The notebook is designed to explore and model employee attrition based on various factors. It is divided into several key sections, each addressing a critical step in the data analysis pipeline.

## Notebook Structure

- **Part 1: Preprocessing** - This section is dedicated to preparing the data for analysis. It includes encoding and scaling the data to make the data suitable for modeling.

- **Model Creation, Compilation, and Training** - Here, the notebook involves setting up a nerual network, compiling it with appropriate metrics and optimizers, and training it on the preprocessed data.

- **Summary** - The notebook concludes with a summary section where critical questions regarding the analysis are answered. These include discussions on the choice of metrics, activation functions, and potential improvements for the model.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. The appropriateness of accuracy as a metric for this analysis.
2. The choice of activation functions for the output layers and the rationale behind these choices.
3. Suggestions for improving the model further.

## How to Use

To use the notebook for your analysis:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the `attrition.ipynb` file directly.
3. Open the notebook in your Jupyter environment.
4. Execute the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis or modify it for your dataset.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and any other library that might be used for machine learning and data visualization.
